Hi Travis. First off, I owe you a lot for helping me so much to switch and adapt in your sections halfway through the quarter.
I understand that having one more student in your section sigificantly increases your overall work and I really appreciate that you took me in. I absolutely love your sections so far.
I initially intended to pair program with Ashwin but it turned out that it was very uncomfortable for him to work in pairs.
Although I could not work with him as I had planned, I deeply enjoy your sections and I am really happy about my choice of switching to your section.
Thank you so much again.
